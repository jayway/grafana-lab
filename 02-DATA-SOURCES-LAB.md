# Data sources lab

## Prometheus

To attach Prometheus as a data source, first install it using docker:
```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

Then attach it in [http://localhost:3000/datasources](http://localhost:3000/datasources). It's not really useful without data. 

It's an empty data source, so not really useful until it is pop
